# mplayer wrapper for FVWM-Crystal
# Written by Dominique Michel <dominique_libre@sourceforge.net>
#
# This file is used by Music-mplayer to control this player.
#
# syntax: 
# fvwm-crystal.mplayer-wrapper <type> <user id> <file>
# where 
# type is one of "list", "file" or "dvd"
# user id is the ouput of "id -un"
# file is the file to send to mplayer (don't apply with "dvd")
#
# The 1 in the loadfile command is to append the playlist/file.
# If you want to replace it, replace the 1 by 0.
