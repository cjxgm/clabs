FVWM-Crystal: Tips & tricks
Written by: Maciej Delmanowski <harnir@berlios.de>
-----------------------------------------------------

Here you can find some random tips for the first run of FVWM-Crystal.
I assume, that you already installed the package (if not, look in INSTALL file
instead), and you are now inside your brand new desktop environment.


* Right click on the desktop opens new terminal window.

* Right click on the Close button will minimize a window. To bring it back,
  click on the icon of the program in the icons panel, or double-click on the
  thumbnail placed on the desktop (if you have a layout with thumbnails
  enabled).

* When you start FVWM-Crystal for the first time, there will be an
  automatically generated panel with applications installed on your system.
  Clicking on an icon of selected application with your RMB will
  launch this application; clicking with LMB will open a menu with other
  similar apps.

* Clicking and holding a mouse button on the titlebar buttons will result in
  opening of a small menu, which contains available commands for this button.
  Letter in brackets indicates, which function will be ececuted when you
  click on the certain button using your left (L), right (R) or middle (M)
  mouse button.

* If a wallpaper was not set at startup, make sure that you have 'habak' or
  'Esetroot' installed and available on your system. Try to set a wallpaper
  using main menu (it may by a little slow at the first time, because
  miniatures have to be generated).

* You can change a wallpaper, window decorations and panel/menu colorsets
  using the main menu (a desk-like icon). Your changes will be automatically
  remembered for the next startup.
