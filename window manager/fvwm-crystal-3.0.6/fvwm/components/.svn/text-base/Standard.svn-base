# You can find here some basic FVWM-Crystal functions

# This function looks for specified file in the user's directory (~/.fvwm/),
# then system-wide directory (/etc/X11/fvwm/fvwm-crystal/), then "package"
# directory (/usr/[local]/share/fvwm-crystal/fvwm) and loads the first one it
# finds. It's useful for files that should be changed/replaced as a whole, ex.
# functions or scripts.
